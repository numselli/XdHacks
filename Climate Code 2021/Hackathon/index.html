            <br>
            <p>One day you wake up feeling quite hot and sweaty.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As you get out of bed, drentched in sweat, you decide to open the windows to get a little breeze in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, as soon as you open your windows, you feel a huge heat wave hit you right in the face.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You question yourself about the strange increase in heat. What are heat waves caused by?</p>

            <h2>Question 2: </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves are detrimental to the environment, and most importantly, to our own well being!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves are notorious for taking our own lives as they may cause health complications like headaches, rashes, dehydration, or even blood clots!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves are also known for their damaging repercussions on surrounding ecosystems!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Often times, when the temperature of the water drastically elevates due to the presence of heat waves, the quality of water also takes a toll for the worse, all while affecting marine life (increase in algue, a.k.a the process of eutrophication, which creates a high risk of fishes dying :o)</p>  
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves ultimately caused by global warming can be stopped as a collective.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What can we do to help people who are unsure of what to do?</p>

            <br>
            <p>As the day goes on, it seems as if it gets hotter, and hotter by the hour!</p> 
            <br>
            <p>You realize that you haven't even turned on the AC!</p>
            <br>
            <p>No wonder it was so hot in your house! However, as you turn your ventilation system, your whole neighborhood goes out!</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Due to the high temperatures caused by the heat wave, many of your fellow neighbours also decided that it was a good idea to turn on 
            the AC at the same time which caused an electrical burnout.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Suddenly, you get a phone call from your friend from another province.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Turns out, she's also facing some trouble: her whole city is having a drought!
