            <p>However, as soon as you open your windows, you feel a huge heat wave hit you right in the face</p>

            <p>You question yourself about the strange increase in heat. What are heat waves caused by?</p>

            <p>Heat waves are detrimental to the environment, and most importantly, to our own well being!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves are notorious for taking our own lives as they may cause health complications like headaches, rashes, dehydration, or even blood clots!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves are also known for their damaging repercussions on surrounding ecosystems!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Often times, when the temperature of the water drastically elevates due to the presence of heat waves, the quality of water also takes a toll for the worse, all while affecting marine life (increase in algue, a.k.a the process of eutrophication, which creates a high risk of fishes dying :o)</p>  
            <br>
            <p>Heat waves ultimately caused by global warming can be stopped as a collective.</p>

            <p>What can we do to help people who are unsure of what to do?</p>
